PclxTool
---

Python based tool for manipulating ``.pclx`` files generated by
[Pencil2D](https://pencil2d.org).

Provided are features that aren't supported by Pencil2D:

- layer duplication
- scaling of frames (entire layers)
- rotation of frames (entire layers)
- copying of frames
- reversing of frames
- interpolation of object movement between two frames
- layer duplication

Used and tested on MacOS, your mileage will vary on Windows.

Workflow / Integration with Pencil2D
---

The workflow that the tool supports is as follows:

1. Open, edit and save animation in P2D
2. Open PclxTool and drag the Pclx file into PclxTool
3. Apply necessary changes.
4. Each change will generate a new ``.pclx`` file.
5. Open the modified ``.pclx`` in P2D and make changes.
6. Rinse and Repeat

How does it work
---

Pclx files are basically Zip files with one XML file describing the
animation and a data directory with a PNG for each frame of each layer.

PclxTool opens the Zip and applies changes to the XML and PNG files (mostly
directly on the PNGs). It will then create a new pclx file with those changes,
the original pclx file is never changed.

PclxTool only works on Bitmap layers, Vector layers are ignored.


Prerequistes
---

PclxTool assumes that both image magick and ffmpeg are installed and can
be found at:

```
CONVERT_EXE  = "/usr/local/bin/convert"
FFMPEG_EXE   = "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg"
```

Also Pencil2D is assumed to be installed at:

```
PENCIL2D_APP = "/Applications/Pencil2D.app/Contents/MacOS/pencil2d"
```

Again, this was tested on MacOS only...
